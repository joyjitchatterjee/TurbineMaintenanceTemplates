# Supplementary data for "A Dual Transformer Model for Intelligent Decision Support for Maintenance of Wind Turbines"

(Accepted)


This repository contains human-authored corpus of maintenance actions for faults in offshore wind turbines. This accompanies our paper
"A Dual Transformer Model for Intelligent Decision Support for Maintenance of Wind Turbines" as a supplementary material.

It includes:-
1. 102 unique sub-phrases, detailing faults and maintenance actions for various types of faults.
2. A collection of 167 templates, each detailing a complete maintenance strategy for specific types of faults, given a particular sequence
of alarm type and relevant features.

Note: The authored maintenance actions are a hypothetical collection of different possible scenarios which we would like to evaluate in our approach- simulated under various types of faults.
Refer https://youtu.be/HSUFzBr_mVQ for a video demo of our approach.

Acknowledgments:-
Special acknowledgment to Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult (ORE Catpault)'s Platform for Operational Data (POD) https://pod.ore.catapult.org.uk, based on which we derived
useful insights for developing these human-authored templates. Also, the SCADA data was utilised from POD as a part of this study.
